# fraud-detection-ml

End-to-end machine learning project for detecting fraudulent financial transactions using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

**Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**  
**Full Python Data Science Project**

---

## Overview

This repository presents an end-to-end machine learning solution for detecting fraudulent financial transactions.

The project demonstrates a production-oriented data science workflow, covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using pipelines, and deployment through a lightweight inference application.

The solution is designed with enterprise banking and financial services use cases in mind, emphasizing reproducibility, interpretability, and deployment readiness.

---

## Business Context

Financial institutions process millions of transactions every day. Even a small percentage of fraudulent activity can result in significant financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory risk.

---

## Objective

To classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate with a focus on:

- Reducing false negatives (missed fraud cases)
- Maintaining model interpretability
- Ensuring consistent and reliable inference behavior
- Supporting deployment in enterprise environments

---

## Technical Approach

### Problem Type
- Binary Classification

### Machine Learning Framework
- Scikit-learn

### Model
- Logistic Regression (interpretable baseline model)

---

## Preprocessing

- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
- Feature scaling for numerical variables

---

## Pipeline Design

End-to-end preprocessing and modeling implemented using:

- `Pipeline`
- `ColumnTransformer`

---

## Model Persistence

- Trained pipeline serialized using **Joblib**

This design ensures that the same transformations applied during training are consistently applied during inference, which is critical in regulated and large-scale environments.

## Application Output (Inference UI)

The project includes a **Streamlit-based inference application** that allows users to:

- Enter transaction details manually
- Perform real-time fraud prediction
- View clear and interpretable prediction results

This interface simulates a fraud screening tool used by operational or risk teams.

## Dataset Summary

Each transaction record contains:

- Transaction type
- Transaction amount
- Sender balance (before and after transaction)
- Receiver balance (before and after transaction)

---

## Target Variable

- **isFraud**
  - `1` → Fraudulent transaction
  - `0` → Legitimate transaction

---

## Model Evaluation Considerations

Evaluation focuses on business-relevant risk metrics, including:

- Precision and Recall
- Confusion Matrix analysis

### Financial Risk Interpretation

- **False Negatives** → Direct financial loss risk
- **False Positives** → Customer experience and operational cost impact

---

## Deployment

A lightweight **Streamlit application** is included to demonstrate:

- Real-time inference using trained ML pipelines
- Integration of data science models into applications
- Deployment-ready artifacts suitable for enterprise workflows
